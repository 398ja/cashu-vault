## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- New `cashu-vault-hashi` module for HashiCorp Vault secrets backend using `spring-vault-core` 3.2.0
- `HashiVaultClient` with CAS-aware KV v2 operations (store, get, delete)
- `HCKeyVault` and `HCKeySetVault` implementations that store private keys in HashiCorp Vault
- `DBMigrationService` for migrating existing private keys from PostgreSQL to HashiCorp Vault
- `HashiVaultConfig` with support for Token, AppRole and Kubernetes authentication
- `HashiVaultRegistrar` for automatic backend registration on startup
- `VaultClientFactory.Backend` enum with `getVault()` method for backend-agnostic vault access
- `VaultClientFactory.registerHCVault()` for pluggable HashiCorp Vault registration
- `vault_path` column on `KeyEntity` for referencing secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault
- V3 Flyway migration: add `vault_path` column, make `private_key` nullable
- HashiCorp Vault service and `vault-init` container in Docker Compose
- `docker.env` / `docker.env.example` for externalized configuration
- Integration tests for `HashiVaultClient` using Testcontainers VaultContainer
- `application-hashicorp.properties` default profile for HashiCorp Vault backend

### Changed

- `VaultClientFactory` now supports dual-backend mode (DB and HashiCorp) with fallback
- `KeyEntity.privateKey` is now nullable to support HashiCorp Vault backend
- Docker Compose refactored to use `env_file` instead of inline environment variables
- Docker Compose now includes persistent volumes for PostgreSQL and Vault data

### Security

- Private keys can now be stored in HashiCorp Vault with KV v2 versioning and audit logging
- AppRole least-privilege policy restricts access to `cashu/` mount paths only
- `docker.env` is gitignored to prevent credential leakage

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- Production Spring profile (`application-prod.properties`) with PostgreSQL and HikariCP configuration
- G1GC garbage collector configuration in Dockerfile with heap sizing and GC logging
- Bean Validation annotations (`@NotBlank`, `@Pattern`, `@Size`, `@Positive`) on all controller path parameters
- `GlobalExceptionHandler` for centralized exception handling with sanitized error messages

### Changed

- Updated cashu-lib dependency to 0.16.0
- Use `TreeMap` instead of `HashMap` in `DBMintVault.getKeys()` to prevent hash collision DoS
- Return defensive copies (unmodifiable collections) from `MintEntity` and `KeySetEntity` getters
- Initialize collections with known sizes for better performance
- HikariCP connection pool tuning (pool size, timeouts, prepared statement caching)

### Security

- Implement Oracle Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE (83% compliance)
- Exception message sanitization to prevent information disclosure
- Input validation on all REST endpoints to prevent injection attacks

### Performance

- Implement Java Performance Tuning recommendations (80% compliance)
- Configure G1GC with 200ms pause time target
- Add heap dump on OOM for production diagnostics

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- Database unique constraints on `(mint_id, secret)` and `(mint_id, C)` to prevent duplicate proof storage
- SHA-256 fingerprint column for token-level duplicate detection with automatic computation via `@PrePersist`
- `insertIfNotExists()` method in ProofRepository with `InsertResult` record for duplicate handling
- `existsByMint_IdAndSecret()`, `existsByMint_IdAndUnblindedSignature()`, and `findByFingerprint()` repository methods
- Comprehensive integration tests for duplicate detection scenarios

### Changed

- ProofVaultController now returns HTTP 409 Conflict when storing duplicate proofs
- Updated cashu-lib dependency to 0.13.0
- Configured maven-surefire-plugin 3.5.3 for JUnit 5 support

### Security

- Implemented proof uniqueness constraints as part of security hardening (P0-VAULT-001 through P0-VAULT-004)
